# A string is considered to be in title case if each word in the string is either
# (a) capitalised (that is, only the first letter of the word is in upper case) or              ***Cr.1.1
# (b) considered to be an exception and put entirely into lower case unless                     ***Cr.2.1
# it is the first word, # which is always capitalised.
#
# Write a function that will convert a string into title case,                                  ***Cr.1
# given an optional list of exceptions (minor words).                                           ***Cr.2
# The list of minor words will be given as a string with each word separated by a space.
# Your function should ignore the case of the minor words string --
# it should behave in the same way even if the case of the minor word string is changed.
#
# First argument (required): the original string to be converted.
# Second argument (optional): space-delimited list of minor words that must always be lowercase
# except for the first word in the string.
#
# Example
# title_case('a clash of KINGS', 'a an the of') # should return: 'A Clash of Kings'
# title_case('THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS', 'The In') # should return: 'The Wind in the Willows'
# title_case('the quick brown fox') # should return: 'The Quick Brown Fox'
